This project was made for the class Models and Technologies for the Financial Industry during the academic year 2023/24

The aim was to find the most relevant features to estimate loan default probability. We also wanted to see which type of models performed better. We tried some logistic regression models as well as some ensemble learning algorithms. The dataset we used was downloaded from kaggle. It contains over a million p2p loans on the platform Lending Club.
